I graduated from Tsinghua Univeristy in 2011, did my master in bioinformatics at Tsinghua, then received my PhD in statistics at Harvard University in 2019. 

My research interest is  to develop new statistical methodologies with application to biological data. My ongoing research are: 

* Bayesian phylogenetics: develop model-based methods to study the molecular basis of phenotypic evolution in multiple species and further identify the function of genomic elements based on their evolutionary profiles and other functional genomics data.

* Single-cell omics: develop statistical tools to discover disease associated cell populations using single cell transcriptome data and further characterize the cell landscape by integrating different omics data at single cell level.

* Deep learning methods in the framework of Bayesian statistics.
